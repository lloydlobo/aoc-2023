    The function uses breadth-first search without back-tracking to traverse the grid. Cells are added to the
    `reachable_cells` set under two conditions:

        1. If the step number is even, all visited cells are implicitly deemed reachable and included in the set.
        2. If the step number is odd, cells are explicitly included based on the condition
           `(step & 1) == visitable_on_odd_steps`. This condition selectively adds cells based on odd or even steps.

    Flexible back-and-forth movements within the remaining steps, ensuring an inclusive definition of "reachable"
    positions.
